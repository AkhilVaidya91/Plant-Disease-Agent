# Methodology for Multi-Modal Plant Disease Diagnosis System

## 1. System Architecture Overview
The proposed plant disease diagnosis system is a sophisticated, multi-modal approach that leverages different artificial intelligence technologies to provide accurate and reliable plant disease identification. The system is designed with a flexible, hierarchical architecture that can adapt to varying levels of available information and model capabilities.

## 2. Model Selection and Routing Mechanism
The core of the system is an intelligent orchestrator agent that dynamically selects the most appropriate diagnostic approach based on the available resources and input data. The routing mechanism follows a strategic decision tree with three primary pathways:

### 2.1 Specialized CNN/Vision Transformer (ViT) Model Path
- **Trigger Condition**: Plant name is present in the specialized model repository
- **Process**:
  1. Retrieve the pre-trained model specific to the identified plant species
  2. Process the input leaf image through the specialized model
  3. Generate disease classification with a confidence score
- **Model Types**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) or Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures

### 2.2 Text-Based Description Matching Path
- **Trigger Condition**: Plant not found in specialized model repository, but present in text-based disease description database
- **Process**:
  1. Retrieve textual disease descriptions for the plant
  2. Create a multi-modal prompt combining image and textual context
  3. Utilize Vision-Language Model (VLM) or Large Language Model (LLM) for classification
  4. Implement few-shot learning techniques to improve accuracy

### 2.3 Web-Sourced Information Retrieval Path
- **Trigger Condition**: Plant not found in existing repositories
- **Process**:
  1. Deploy web agent to collect information from reliable botanical and agricultural sources
  2. Structured data extraction and JSON formatting
  3. Augment text-based disease description database
  4. Utilize VLM for disease classification using newly acquired information

## 3. Confidence Validation Mechanism
To ensure high diagnostic reliability, the system incorporates a confidence validation layer:

- If the initial CNN/ViT model returns a confidence score below 0.25 (25%)
- Trigger secondary validation using Vision-Language Model (VLM)
- Compare and cross-validate classification results
- Provide the most consistent output to the user

## 4. Key Technological Components
- **Image Processing**: CNN and Vision Transformer models
- **Multimodal Learning**: Vision-Language Models
- **Knowledge Retrieval**: Web scraping and structured data extraction
- **Classification Techniques**: Few-shot learning, confidence-based validation

## 5. Data Management
- Maintain a dynamic, expandable repository of:
  - Specialized plant disease models
  - Textual disease descriptions
  - Web-sourced botanical information
- Implement continuous learning and model update mechanisms

## 6. Output Generation
The system generates a comprehensive output including:
- Predicted plant disease name
- Confidence score
- Potential additional contextual information
- Recommended actions (if applicable)
